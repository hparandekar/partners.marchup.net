                <p class="text-muted" style="margin-top: 20px;">As part of our sponsorship terms, we require that sponsored events be hosted on the Marchup platform. Organizers will create a dedicated space for the event, allowing participants to set up child spaces for their projects. This approach increases engagement on our platform and streamlines organization and consistency for event organizers. We will also help with marketing by promoting your event through our LinkedIn, Instagram, and Marchup communities, to maximize visibility and participation.</p>
