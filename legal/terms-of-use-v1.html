<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Certainly! To cover all current and future features that use Generative AI services, including the "Download my resume" feature and any others you may introduce, you can generalize the clause to be more encompassing. Here's a suggested revision:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Use of Generative AI Services</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In various features of marchup.net, we may utilize Generative AI services provided by third-party providers, such as AWS Bedrock AI and others, to enhance your experience and offer advanced functionalities. These features may include, but are not limited to, resume generation, content personalization, and other AI-driven services. By using any of these features, you understand and agree to the following:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1. Transfer of Information: For the functionality of these features, certain information from your Marchup profile or input provided by you may be shared with third-party Generative AI services. This could include personal, educational, and professional details necessary for the specific AI-driven feature you are utilizing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2. Data Privacy and Consent: We are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of your information. Information shared with third-party AI services will be limited to what is necessary for the feature in question. By using these AI-driven features, you consent to the sharing of your relevant information with these third-party services, in accordance with our privacy policy and the privacy policies of the respective AI service providers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3. Third-Party Terms and Conditions: The generation and processing of content through these AI services are subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the respective third-party providers. While we endeavor to partner with reputable AI service providers, we do not imply endorsement of all their practices and are not responsible for their processing of your data beyond the scope of the specific feature.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">4. Accuracy and Limitation of Liability: While we aim to provide high-quality and accurate AI-driven services, Marchup is not liable for any errors, inaccuracies, or misrepresentations produced by third-party AI services. It remains your responsibility to review and verify the accuracy and suitability of the content generated before any reliance or use.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Changes and Notifications: As we continue to innovate, additional AI-driven features may be introduced, and we reserve the right to modify the scope of AI services used. Any significant changes in how we use Generative AI services will be communicated to our users in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Third Party Accounts</b> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You will be able to connect your Marchup account to third party accounts. By connecting your Marchup account to your third party account, you acknowledge and agree that you are consenting to the continuous release of information about you to others (in accordance with your privacy settings on those third party sites). If you do not want information about you to be shared in this manner, do not use this feature.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Pricing and Changes to Service Charges</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As of the effective date of these Terms and Conditions, the services offered on marchup.net are provided to you free of charge. However, Marchup reserves the right to introduce a fee or charge for the services offered on the Site. Any changes to the pricing structure will be made at the sole discretion of the Marchup Inc.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the event that Marchup decides to introduce such fees or change the existing pricing structure, we will provide reasonable notice to all our users by posting the changes on the Site or through other communication channels as deemed appropriate. It is always your choice whether or not to continue using our services under the new pricing terms, and we will strive to ensure that any changes are fair and reasonable.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>International Users</b> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Service is controlled, operated and administered by Marchup from our offices within the USA. If you access the Service from a location outside the USA, you are responsible for compliance with all local laws. You agree that you will not use the Marchup Content accessed through marchup.net in any country or in any manner prohibited by any applicable laws, restrictions or regulations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Indemnification</b> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Marchup, its officers, directors, employees, agents and third parties, for any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) relating to or arising out of your use of or inability to use the Site or services, any user postings made by you, your violation of any terms of this Agreement or your violation of any rights of a third party, or your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. Marchup reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Marchup in asserting any available defenses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Arbitration</b> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Class Action Waiver</b> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Marchup agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Liability Disclaimer</b> </span></p>
